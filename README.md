# Generation of Competitive Prices in the Used Car Market through Neural Networks.

In the dynamic used car market, determining a competitive price is essential to attract buyers and maximize sales. However, this task becomes increasingly challenging due to the large number of influencing variables and the lack of structured information. In this context, this study proposed a solution based on the use of neural networks to generate competitive prices for used cars.
